//! Managed-multiplexer launch orchestration for Lemonade.
//!
//! llama.cpp spawns one supervised child *per model*. Lemonade is different:
//! one long-lived `lemond` umbrella serves every model behind its API
//! This module owns the umbrella's lifecycle — ensuring exactly one
//! `lemond` is supervised and ready before any per-model work is delegated
//! to it.
//!
//! The umbrella reuses the **generic** [`crate::daemon::supervisor`]: it is
//! just a [`ProcessLaunchSpec`] whose
//! readiness is `lemond`'s `/live` endpoint. Because the supervisor keys a
//! [`ManagedModel`] by a [`crate::gguf::identity::ModelId`], the umbrella —
//! which is not a GGUF model — is registered under a synthetic id (path =
//! the `lemond` binary, sentinel header hash) and a reserved
//! [`umbrella_launch_id`].
//!
//! The umbrella is brought up from two callers, both via [`ensure_umbrella`]:
//! the daemon's boot-time supervision (when the Lemonade backend is enabled)
//! and the per-model `start_model` path. Per-model routing reads the catalog
//! `backend` tag and forwards through the proxy to the umbrella's port.
