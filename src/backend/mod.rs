//! The `Backend` seam: everything currently hardwired to `llama-server`
//! on the **launch / supervise / identify** side, expressed as a
//! contract so other inference engines can plug in.
//!
//! This module + [`llama_cpp`] provide the contract with
//! llama.cpp as the reference implementation. This module is the
//! backend-agnostic foundation: a
//! second engine plugs in by implementing [`Backend`], adding a variant to
//! [`Backends`] (+ its match arms), and registering its
//! [`identity`]/selection arms — no change to the supervisor, proxy, or
//! resolver. The generic process-supervision machinery in
//! [`crate::daemon::supervisor`] (state machine, log rotation, ring buffer,
//! resource sampler, exit watcher, signal handling) is shared by every
//! backend — only the backend-specific spots live behind this seam:
//! argv/launch translation, the env strip, the readiness endpoint, and
//! identity.
//!
//! See `docs/plans/2026-06-08-001-refactor-backend-trait-abstraction-plan.md`
//! and the origin brainstorm
//! `docs/brainstorms/2026-06-08-multi-backend-abstraction-requirements.md`.
//!
//! # Two lifecycle shapes
//!
//! The contract does not assume **one process per model**. Two shapes
//! exist, one per [`Lifecycle`]:
//!
//! - **Process-per-model** ([`llama_cpp`]): llamastash spawns one
//!   `llama-server` per model and owns its full lifecycle. The launch
//!   produces a [`LaunchPlan::SpawnProcess`].
//! - **Managed-multiplexer**: a backend supervises one long-lived umbrella
//!   process and delegates per-model start/list to its API. The launch
//!   produces a [`LaunchPlan::DelegateToManager`] carrying the umbrella
//!   [`ProcessLaunchSpec`] + the model to serve. [`Backend::prepare_launch`]
//!   stays synchronous for both shapes — the async API call happens when the
//!   plan is *executed*. Lemonade ([`lemonade`]) is the first
//!   managed-multiplexer backend.
//!
//! # Generalized identity
//!
//! [`Backend::identify`] returns the seam-level [`identity::ModelIdentity`]
//! (GGUF or backend-registry), wrapping the unchanged GGUF
//! [`crate::gguf::identity::ModelId`] so `state.json` is preserved. A
//! file-less backend-registry model rides the same persisted maps as GGUF
//! rows — reusable by any future backend.
