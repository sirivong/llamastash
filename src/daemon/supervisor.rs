//! Spawn and shepherd one supervised child process for a user-requested
//! launch. Backend-agnostic: the binary, argv, env strip, and readiness
//! check all arrive in the [`ProcessLaunchSpec`] the backend produced
//! (see [`crate::backend`]); for llama.cpp that child is `llama-server`.
//! Owns the state machine
//! `Launching → Loading → Ready | Error{cause} → Stopping → Stopped`,
//! plus the stdout/stderr tee to a rotating log file and an
//! in-memory ring buffer (for the TUI Logs tab).
//!
//! Each `ManagedModel` is one supervisor instance — the daemon
//! holds a `BTreeMap<ModelId, ManagedModel>` keyed by canonical
//! model id (a single GGUF can be launched multiple times against
//! different ports; the daemon disambiguates by a `launch_id`
//! the supervisor generates).
//!
//! Process lifecycle:
//! 1. Spawn child with `Stdio::piped` stdout/stderr; apply
//!    `setsid` in `pre_exec` so the child survives daemon exit.
//! 2. Spawn one tokio task per stream that tees lines to the log
//!    file (rotating at 10 MiB, max 5 files per launch) and to a
//!    bounded ring buffer of the last 4096 lines.
//! 3. Hand the (pid, port) to `probe::poll_until_ready` with the
//!    backend's readiness endpoint; on the ready status, transition
//!    Loading → Ready. Timeout → Error.
//! 4. `stop()` sends SIGTERM, waits 5 s, sends SIGKILL if still
//!    alive. State transitions reflect each step.
