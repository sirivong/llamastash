//! Filesystem discovery: scan roots for `.gguf` files, group split-shard
//! sets, surface them on a streaming `mpsc::Receiver` so the TUI can
//! render rows as they arrive (origin: R1, R9).
//!
//! Module layout mirrors the responsibilities in the v1 plan:
//! - [`scanner`] — walk one or more roots and emit `DiscoveredModel`s.
//! - [`split_gguf`] — collapse `*-NNNNN-of-MMMMM.gguf` sets into one
//!   user-visible entry.
//!
//! Cache-aware enumerators (HuggingFace, Ollama, LM Studio), the
//! filesystem watcher, and the HuggingFace pull worker live in the
//! sibling modules.
