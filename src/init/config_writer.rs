//! Init wizard's config.yaml write half.
//!
//! Thin user-facing wrapper around the
//! [`crate::config::writer::merge_and_write`] primitive that adds:
//! - human-friendly + JSON diff rendering,
//! - secret-key redaction (path matches `token` / `secret` /
//!   `password` substring → value rendered as `<redacted>`),
//! - non-interactive / interactive confirm hook,
//! - managed_keys list build that the wizard then stamps into
//!   `_init_snapshot.json`.
//!
//! The actual atomic rename + 0600 mode + symlink/parent-mode refusal
//! all live in that primitive — this module never touches the
//! filesystem itself.
//!
//! Redaction allowlist, diff rendering, and the [`RedactedDiffEntry`]
//! type live in [`crate::util::config_patch`] so the external-tool
//! patchers (`init::external::*`) inherit the same policy.
