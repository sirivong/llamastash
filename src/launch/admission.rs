//! Pre-spawn memory admission control + in-memory reservation ledger (R4).
//!
//! llamastash delegates *placement* to llama-server's `--fit` but keeps
//! *budget authority*: before spawning a child it projects the launch's
//! demand floor against the sampled, post-headroom free memory minus the
//! bytes already reserved by in-flight launches. If the demand does not
//! fit, the launch is refused **before** spawn (cheap, deterministic) so
//! two concurrent oversized models can never double-book the same free
//! reading and OOM the box — the failure `--fit` alone can't prevent on
//! UMA, where its own free reading conflates the GTT pool with system
//! RAM.
//!
//! Design (kept deliberately simple — see plan scope amendment):
//! - **One combined budget.** UMA / Apple hosts budget the single
//!   physical pool (≈ system RAM); discrete hosts sum VRAM + system RAM.
//!   We compare combined demand against combined free rather than
//!   modelling a per-pool GPU/RAM split — conservative and adequate as a
//!   safety net.
//! - **Reservation = full demand**, held from admit until the child
//!   settles (Ready / Error / Stopped). While a child is Loading the
//!   sampler also sees its growing allocation, so the budget is counted
//!   slightly conservatively during that window — it errs toward
//!   refusing a second concurrent launch, never toward OOM.
//! - **Best-effort.** When there is no host-metrics sample yet
//!   (`unsampled`, or no sampler wired as in many tests) admission is
//!   skipped and the launch proceeds — we never block on missing data.
//! - **Never refuse on missing geometry.** A model whose GGUF lacks the
//!   attention fields contributes only its known weight bytes to demand.
