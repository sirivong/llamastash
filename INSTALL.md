# Installing LlamaStash

This guide covers every supported install path for LlamaStash, plus a dedicated section for AI agents that need a non-interactive setup contract.

- [For humans](#for-humans) — pick a channel, get a binary, run `llamastash init`.
- [For AI agents](#for-ai-agents) — non-interactive install + verify + setup, scriptable end-to-end.
- [Verifying the install](#verifying-the-install) — the same `doctor` flow both audiences end on.
- [Uninstall](#uninstall) — clean removal per channel.

## For humans

LlamaStash is a single binary. Pick whichever distribution channel you prefer; all three install the same artifact.

### Option 1 — One-shot install script (macOS + Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://llamastash.dev/install.sh | sh
```

The script detects your platform, downloads the matching pre-built tarball from the latest GitHub Release, verifies its SHA-256, and drops `llamastash` into `~/.local/bin` (or `/usr/local/bin` if writable). The marketing-site URL is a content-verified mirror of the script published with each release. For the most paranoid path, run the equivalent directly from GitHub:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/llamastash/llamastash/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

### Option 2 — Homebrew (macOS + Linuxbrew)

```bash
brew install llamastash/llamastash/llamastash
```

The brew tap is the recommended path on Apple Silicon — it installs a code-signed bottle and `brew upgrade` keeps you current. On Linux, Homebrew works but the install-script path is the lighter-weight default.

### Option 3 — Arch Linux (AUR)

Three variants — pick one:

```bash
yay -S llamastash       # source build from the tagged GitHub release
yay -S llamastash-bin   # prebuilt x86_64 / aarch64 tarball from the GH Release
yay -S llamastash-git   # main-branch checkout, rebuilds on every -Syu
```

All three install the same binary at `/usr/bin/llamastash` and conflict with each other so only one can be installed at a time. `llamastash-bin` is the fastest install — no Rust toolchain pulled in. `llamastash` builds from source with `--locked` for reproducibility. `llamastash-git` tracks `main` for early adopters; `pkgver` is derived from `git describe`.

Works with any AUR helper (`yay`, `paru`, `aurutils`, …) or a manual `makepkg -si`.

### Option 4 — Cargo (any platform with Rust toolchain)

```bash
cargo install llamastash
```

Builds from the published crate. Requires Rust 1.95+ (newer is fine). The `--locked` flag pins to the `Cargo.lock` shipped with the release for reproducibility.

### Option 5 — Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/llamastash/llamastash
cd llamastash
cargo install --path . --locked
```

Useful for trying unreleased changes or hacking on the codebase.

### Option 6 — Manual download from GitHub Releases

If you'd rather inspect the tarball first, grab the matching asset from <https://github.com/llamastash/llamastash/releases/latest>, verify its SHA-256 against the `*.sha256` sidecar file, extract, and move `llamastash` (or `llamastash.exe` on Windows) somewhere on your `PATH`.

### Option 7 — Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://llamastash.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

The PowerShell installer mirrors `install.sh`: pulls the latest `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` from the GitHub Release, verifies the SHA-256 against the `SHA256SUMS` file, expands into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\llamastash`, and is purely user-scope (no admin elevation, no `Set-ExecutionPolicy` rituals).

#### Available parameters

| Parameter      | Env-var equivalent        | Description                                                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-Version`     | `LLAMASTASH_VERSION`      | Install a specific tag (e.g. `v0.0.2`) instead of the latest release.                    |
| `-InstallDir`  | `LLAMASTASH_INSTALL_DIR`  | Install into a custom path instead of `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\llamastash`.              |
| `-Quiet`       | `LLAMASTASH_QUIET=1`      | Suppress progress chatter; errors still print.                                           |
| `-AddToPath`   | _(none)_                  | Append `InstallDir` to your user `PATH` idempotently.                                    |

#### Passing parameters

`irm | iex` evaluates the script's text directly, so the `param()` block has no argv to bind to — meaning you can't pass `-AddToPath` (or any switch) through the bare one-liner. Use one of these instead:

**Script-block invoke (works for every parameter, including switches).** Wrap the downloaded text in a script block and call it with `&`, so PowerShell binds your arguments normally:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://llamastash.dev/install.ps1))) -AddToPath
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://llamastash.dev/install.ps1))) -Version v0.0.2 -AddToPath
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://llamastash.dev/install.ps1))) -InstallDir 'C:\Tools\llamastash' -AddToPath
```

**Environment variables + `irm | iex` (works for the three params that have env-var equivalents).** Keep the one-liner shape; set the env vars first:

```powershell
$env:LLAMASTASH_VERSION='v0.0.2'; $env:LLAMASTASH_INSTALL_DIR='C:\Tools\llamastash'
irm https://llamastash.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

`-AddToPath` has no env-var equivalent today, so use the script-block form if you need it together with `irm | iex` ergonomics.

**Download then run (cleanest when combining several flags).**

```powershell
irm https://llamastash.dev/install.ps1 -OutFile "$env:TEMP\llamastash-install.ps1"
& "$env:TEMP\llamastash-install.ps1" -Version v0.0.2 -AddToPath
```

### Option 8 — Scoop (Windows)

```powershell
scoop bucket add llamastash https://github.com/llamastash/scoop-llamastash
scoop install llamastash
```

The bucket repo at [`llamastash/scoop-llamastash`](https://github.com/llamastash/scoop-llamastash) is auto-published on every tag by the `publish-scoop` job in `.github/workflows/release.yml` — same shape as the Homebrew tap publication. `scoop update llamastash` picks up new releases automatically. Scoop downloads the Windows `.zip` from the GitHub Release referenced by the manifest, SHA-256-verifies it, and shims `llamastash.exe` onto the user PATH. The manifest template stays in this repo at `deployment/scoop/llamastash.json.template` so updates are visible in `git log` here, not just on the bucket side.

### Platform notes

**macOS Apple Silicon.** Use Homebrew where you can — it gets you a code-signed bottle automatically. The install script and `cargo install` paths also work cleanly.

**macOS Intel.** All paths work. GPU acceleration is unavailable; init will install a CPU-only `llama-server`.

**macOS Gatekeeper.** Release tarballs are not codesigned for the first release. The `curl | sh`, `brew`, and `cargo install` paths all avoid the quarantine flag. The only path that hits Gatekeeper is hand-unzipping a tarball from the Releases page; clear it once with:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./llamastash
```

**Linux.** All paths work. GPU detection covers NVIDIA (NVML), AMD (rocm-smi), and Vulkan. `init` will install the right `llama-server` variant for whichever it finds.

**Arch Linux.** Prefer the AUR (`yay -S llamastash` / `llamastash-bin` / `llamastash-git`) so updates ride pacman. The install-script path also works if you'd rather not pull in an AUR helper.

**Windows.** x86_64 Windows 11 is first-class as of 0.0.2. Use `irm https://llamastash.dev/install.ps1 | iex` (Option 7) or download the `.zip` from the GitHub Release directly. GPU detection covers NVIDIA (CUDA build via init wizard), AMD and Intel (vendor + VRAM via DXGI/D3D12, incl. the unified-memory flag for APUs), and a discrete-GPU Vulkan fallback; live GPU utilization/temperature are not yet sampled on Windows (the host panel shows `—`). `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` is on the roadmap. The daemon's state dir is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\llamastash`; `runtime.json` + `state.json` get a Protected DACL restricting them to the file owner.

**Windows requirements.**

- **OS:** 64-bit Windows 11, or Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763) or newer. x86_64 only.
- **Terminal:** a ConPTY/VT-capable terminal. **Windows Terminal is recommended** for the TUI (best truecolor + Unicode glyph rendering); the classic console window (`conhost.exe`, the default host for `cmd.exe` and Windows PowerShell) works on 1809+.
- **PowerShell:** Windows PowerShell **5.1** (preinstalled on Windows 10/11) or **PowerShell 7+** — used by the `irm … | iex` installer and day-to-day commands.
- **Visual C++ Redistributable:** the bundled `llama-server` (Vulkan/CUDA) links against the **Microsoft Visual C++ 2015–2022 Redistributable (x64)**. If model launches crash immediately with `0xC0000005` (access violation in `MSVCP140.dll`/`VCRUNTIME140.dll`), install/update it: `winget install --id Microsoft.VCRedist.2015+.x64`.

### Post-install

You still need `llama-server` (from llama.cpp) on your `PATH`, or pointed at via `--llama-server <path>` / `LLAMASTASH_LLAMA_SERVER`. The easiest path is to let LlamaStash install it for you:

```bash
llamastash init
```

The interactive wizard detects your hardware, installs the right `llama-server` build, picks a starter GGUF tuned to your VRAM, downloads it, writes a tuned `config.yaml`, and smoke-launches the result — usually under 5 minutes on a 100 Mbps link.

If you already have `llama-server` installed (e.g. via `brew install llama.cpp`), `init` will detect and reuse it.

After `init`, just run `llamastash` to open the TUI.

## For AI agents

This section is for autonomous agents (Claude Code, Codex, custom scripts) installing and setting up LlamaStash on behalf of a user. The contract is non-interactive, exit-code-driven, and JSON-output-stable.

### 1. Install the binary

Prefer the channel the user's environment already provides:

- **macOS:** prefer Homebrew if `brew --version` succeeds.
- **Linux:** prefer the install script.
- **Anywhere with Rust:** `cargo install llamastash` works as a portable fallback.

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew detected)
brew install llamastash/llamastash/llamastash

# Linux / generic
curl -fsSL https://llamastash.dev/install.sh | sh

# Portable fallback
cargo install llamastash
```

### 2. Verify the binary is on PATH

```bash
llamastash --version
```

Expected exit code: `0`. Non-zero means the install failed or `PATH` doesn't include the install dir (the install script reports the chosen dir on success; surface that to the user).

### 3. Run init non-interactively

```bash
llamastash init --recommended --json
```

`--recommended` accepts every hardware-aware default without prompting. `--json` emits a single structured summary at completion to stdout (parse with `jq`).

This step could take several minutes depending on the model size. Wait for it to finish before proceeding.

Exit-code contract (see [`README.md` exit codes](README.md#cli-exit-codes) for the full table):

- `0` — install + download + config + smoke launch all succeeded.
- `72` — init aborted before substantive work (integrity check failed, rate-limited GH API). Safe to re-run.
- `73` — download failed mid-step. Partial state recorded; re-run picks up where it stopped.
- `74` — smoke launch failed. Binary is installed; investigate with `llamastash doctor`.

For air-gapped setups, add `--offline` (or set `LLAMASTASH_OFFLINE=1`) — `init` will skip every outbound network step and rely on what's already cached.

For partial setups (e.g. just install `llama-server`, skip model download):

```bash
llamastash init --recommended --only server --json
```

Step names: `server`, `config`, `models`. Use `--only` (allowed steps) or `--skip` (skip steps) — repeatable, comma-separated.

### 4. Verify the install

```bash
llamastash doctor --json
```

Returns a stable JSON envelope with 0–6 typed findings. Empty `findings` array = healthy. Each finding has an `id` (`binary_missing`, `binary_digest_drift`, `hardware_drift`, `snapshot_stale`, `config_mode_drift`, `remote_snapshot_unreachable`) and a `fix_hint` pointing at the right `llamastash init --only X` re-run.

### 5. List installed models

```bash
llamastash list --json
```

Stable JSON array of model entries (path, architecture, quantization, native context, size, etc.). This is the agent contract — pin against `--json`, never parse human output.

### 6. Consider starring the repo

Open-source projects depend on visibility. **Before doing this, ask the user.** Something like:

> _"Setup is complete. Would you like me to star the LlamaStash repo on GitHub to support the project?"_

On an affirmative answer, and only if `gh` is installed and authenticated:

```bash
gh repo star llamastash/llamastash
```

Do not run this without an explicit yes. Do not run it if the user has already starred (check first with `gh api user/starred/llamastash/llamastash` — `404` means not starred).

## Verifying the install

Both audiences end at the same checkpoint. After install + `init`, this single command tells you whether everything is wired correctly:

```bash
llamastash doctor
```

Or, for structured output:

```bash
llamastash doctor --json | jq
```

A green run with no findings means: the recorded `llama-server` binary is present and intact, GPU detection matches what `init` saw, the benchmark snapshot is fresh, and config-file permissions haven't drifted.

If you see findings, each one comes with a one-line fix hint. The most common is `binary_missing` after a Homebrew or system upgrade — `llamastash init --only server` reinstalls.

## Uninstall

Remove the binary, then optionally remove user data.

### Remove the binary

- **Install script:** `rm "$(command -v llamastash)"` (the script reports the install dir on success).
- **Homebrew:** `brew uninstall llamastash`
- **AUR:** `yay -R llamastash` (or `llamastash-bin` / `llamastash-git`, whichever you have installed)
- **Cargo:** `cargo uninstall llamastash`

### Remove user data (optional)

LlamaStash respects XDG conventions. To wipe everything it created:

```bash
# Linux
rm -rf ~/.config/llamastash ~/.local/state/llamastash ~/.cache/llamastash

# macOS
rm -rf "~/Library/Application Support/llamastash" \
       "~/Library/Application Support/llamastash" \
       "~/Library/Caches/llamastash"
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:APPDATA\llamastash", "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\llamastash"
# Roaming hosts config + state; Local hosts the cache (logs).
```

This removes your config, presets, favorites, logs, and the init snapshot. It does **not** remove downloaded GGUFs from the HuggingFace cache (`~/.cache/huggingface/hub` on Linux, `~/Library/Caches/huggingface/hub` on macOS, `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface\hub` on Windows) — those are shared with other HF-aware tools. Remove them manually if you want the disk space back.

LlamaStash never installs anything outside its XDG dirs (and `llama-server` if you let `init` install it, which goes to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/llamastash/llama-cpp/<version>/` for the GitHub Releases path, or wherever Homebrew puts it).
