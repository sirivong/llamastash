**Zero-overhead, terminal-native local-LLM launcher.**

A fast TUI **and** CLI with init wizard for launching local LLMs. One Rust binary that's a TUI, a CLI, a daemon, and an OpenAI-compatible proxy. [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) is the direct, zero-overhead default backend (vs raw `llama-server`), plus [Lemonade](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade) for NPU / multi-engine inference and [ds4](https://github.com/antirez/ds4) for DeepSeek-V4. See [benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md).

## Why

Heavy abstractions (Ollama, LM Studio) hide llama.cpp; raw `llama-server` use is tedious. LlamaStash is a fast, transparent launcher that is also a first-class shell-tool surface for agents — one binary, daemon on demand, same primitives in the TUI and the CLI.

> **AI agents installing this for a user:** jump to [`INSTALL.md` § For AI agents](INSTALL.md#for-ai-agents). The non-interactive install + verify contract, and exit-code branching live there.

## Install

Pick whichever channel you prefer — all install the same binary. Full per-platform notes, troubleshooting, and the agent-friendly non-interactive path live in [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md).

```bash
# macOS + Linux, one-shot
curl -fsSL https://llamastash.dev/install.sh | sh

# Windows 11 (PowerShell, no admin elevation)
irm https://llamastash.dev/install.ps1 | iex

# Homebrew (macOS + Linuxbrew)
brew install llamastash/llamastash/llamastash

# Arch Linux (AUR — pick one)
yay -S llamastash       # source build

# From crates.io (any platform with a Rust toolchain)
cargo install llamastash

# Windows via Scoop bucket
scoop bucket add llamastash https://github.com/llamastash/scoop-llamastash && scoop install llamastash
```

_Windows: 64-bit Windows 10 1809+ / Windows 11, PowerShell 5.1+, [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal) recommended for the TUI; the bundled `llama-server` needs the VC++ 2015–2022 Redistributable (x64). See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#platform-notes)._

Then run `llamastash init` — the interactive wizard installs `llama-server` for your hardware, downloads a starter GGUF, writes a tuned config, and smoke-launches it.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Open the TUI. Scans default caches; daemon auto-spawns on demand.
llamastash

# List discovered models. TTY → padded + table; piped or
# `--no-colors` → TSV bytes. `--json` is the agent contract.
llamastash list
llamastash list --json | jq

# Launch a model by name, name substring, path, or canonical id.
llamastash start qwen-coder --ctx 16384 --reasoning on

# Drive a smoke-test request against the running endpoint.
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:41100/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model": "qwen-coder", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]}'

# Stop it.
llamastash stop qwen-coder
```

**Tip — mouse focus.** Mouse capture is off by default so the terminal keeps native click-and-drag text selection. To opt in on every TUI run, alias the binary in your shell rc:

```bash
# bash / zsh
alias llamastash='llamastash --mouse-focus'

# fish
alias llamastash 'llamastash --mouse-focus'
```

Or set it permanently in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
mouse_focus: true
```

Either source flips on click-to-focus for the Models list, the right pane, and the tab labels (`Settings`/`Logs`/`Chat`/`Embed`/`Rerank`). Most terminals still expose a bypass modifier (Shift on iTerm2 / Alacritty / foot / wezterm, Option on Apple Terminal) so ad-hoc selection stays reachable.

Prefer a Vulkan `llama-server` build on AMD/NVIDIA hosts: [`docs/usage.md#preferring-a-vulkan-llama-server-build`](docs/usage.md#preferring-a-vulkan-llama-server-build). Architecture and IPC contract: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md). When things go wrong: [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Agent Skills

The CLI ships with an [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) manifest so supported agents can load repo-specific instructions for using `llamastash` as a local model-management CLI.

- Canonical skill bundle: [`skills/llamastash/`](https://github.com/llamastash/llamastash/tree/main/skills/llamastash)

**Any supported agent (recommended):** install the bundled skill with the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) CLI. It auto-detects your harness and writes the bundle to the right path:

```bash
npx skills add llamastash/llamastash
```

**Claude Code plugin marketplace:** install the repo as a plugin, then install the bundled skill:

```text
/plugin marketplace add llamastash/llamastash
/plugin install llamastash@llamastash
/reload-plugins
```

Manual install examples:

```bash
# OpenClaw
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/skills && cp -r skills/llamastash ~/.openclaw/skills/

# OpenCode
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills && cp -r skills/llamastash ~/.config/opencode/skills/
```

The skill teaches agents to prefer `--json`, branch on LlamaStash's documented exit codes, reuse exact discovered model names, and read `status --json` `proxy.listen` before configuring an OpenAI-compatible client.

## Features

Full detail per feature in [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md) — including trade-offs, contracts, and links into [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md).

### [Zero-to-chat in one command](FEATURES.md#zero-to-chat-in-one-command)

- [`llamastash init` — first-run wizard](FEATURES.md#llamastash-init--first-run-wizard) that detects hardware, installs `llama-server`, picks + downloads a starter GGUF, writes a tuned config, and smoke-launches.
- [Hardware-aware model recommender](FEATURES.md#hardware-aware-model-recommender) with a VRAM-fit filter + composite ranking over a CI-refreshed benchmark snapshot.
- [`llamastash doctor`](FEATURES.md#llamastash-doctor--read-only-health-check) — typed, agent-branchable findings; always exits `0`.

### [Discovers what you already have](FEATURES.md#discovers-what-you-already-have)

- [Auto-scans HuggingFace, Ollama, and LM Studio caches](FEATURES.md#auto-scans-huggingface-ollama-and-lm-studio-caches), plus user paths.
- [Rich GGUF intelligence](FEATURES.md#rich-gguf-intelligence) — architecture, params, quant, native context, chat template, KV-cache-aware memory estimates.
- [Multimodal projector detection](FEATURES.md#multimodal-projector-detection) — auto-pairs an mmproj GGUF beside a model, loads it with `--mmproj`, flags vision (`◉`) / audio (`♪`) in the TUI.
- [Smart deduplication](FEATURES.md#smart-deduplication) — symlinks collapsed, split GGUFs unified, Ollama blobs named.
- [Live filesystem watching](FEATURES.md#live-filesystem-watching) — new GGUFs appear without a restart.

### [Launches anything, supervises everything](FEATURES.md#launches-anything-supervises-everything)

- [Daemon-on-demand](FEATURES.md#daemon-on-demand) — one binary as TUI + CLI + daemon; running models survive TUI close.
- [Multi-model concurrency](FEATURES.md#multi-model-concurrency) — per-model port from a configurable range, `/health`-probed state machine.
- [GPU-aware built-in arch defaults](FEATURES.md#gpu-aware-built-in-arch-defaults) — sensible flags per `(architecture, gpu_backend)` with zero YAML.
- [Intelligent context auto-fit](FEATURES.md#intelligent-context-auto-fit) — when `ctx` is unset, llamastash picks the largest context that fits free VRAM (or RAM, CPU-only) from the GGUF attention geometry. Sidesteps llama.cpp `--fit`'s 4096 collapse on Linux 7+ iGPUs (AMD Strix Halo) where unified-memory free space is mis-reported.
- [Typed launch-knob editor](FEATURES.md#typed-launch-knob-editor) with `(source)` chips and a layered preset → last-params → arch-defaults → built-ins resolver.
- [Multi-GPU device selection](FEATURES.md#typed-launch-knob-editor) — pin a model to one card (`--device`) instead of letting llama.cpp split it across every GPU; the picker lists exactly what `llama-server --list-devices` reports.
- [Named presets, favorites, last-params recall](FEATURES.md#named-presets-favorites-last-params-recall) — presets live in `config.yaml` (per-model or per-arch), edited from the CLI, the TUI `Ctrl+P` save dialog, or by hand; a preset cycle row in the Settings form picks one in a keystroke.

### [A TUI that doesn't get in your way](FEATURES.md#a-tui-that-doesnt-get-in-your-way)

- [Keyboard-driven everywhere](FEATURES.md#keyboard-driven-everywhere) — vim-style `hjkl` + `Ctrl+F`/`Ctrl+B` paging, `0`/`$` top/bottom, `gt`/`gT` tab cycling; `/` filter, `u`/`c`/`p` yank, `?` help.
- [Right pane is your smoke test](FEATURES.md#right-pane-is-your-smoke-test) — Logs / Chat / Embed / Rerank over the same OpenAI-compatible endpoints external clients use.
- [In-TUI HuggingFace browser](FEATURES.md#in-tui-huggingface-browser) — search, sort, paginate, per-file hardware fit, download strip with cancel.
- [Theming and rebinding](FEATURES.md#theming-and-rebinding) — five themes + custom palette; every action rebindable.
- [Accessible by default](FEATURES.md#accessible-by-default) — dual-encoded status (color + glyph), readable on mono terminals.
- [Adaptive layout — works from 60 cells up](FEATURES.md#adaptive-layout--works-from-60-cells-up) — below 100 cells the right pane goes drill-in-only; list columns and hint chips drop by priority rank as the pane shrinks so the model name stays readable.

### [First-class CLI for agents and scripts](FEATURES.md#first-class-cli-for-agents-and-scripts)

- [Subcommands cover every TUI capability](FEATURES.md#subcommands-cover-every-tui-capability) with `--json` as the stable agent contract.
- [Documented exit codes per failure class](FEATURES.md#documented-exit-codes-per-failure-class) — pin numbers, not message text.
- [Colored TTY output, byte-stable TSV when piped](FEATURES.md#colored-tty-output-byte-stable-tsv-when-piped) — existing `awk` / `column` pipelines keep working.
- [`llamastash pull <hf-repo>`](FEATURES.md#llamastash-pull-hf-repo--standalone-hf-fetch) — same primitive as the wizard, with disk-space prechecks.
- [`llamastash recommend`](FEATURES.md#llamastash-recommend--hardware-aware-picks-in-your-shell) — the recommender on its own, agent-friendly.
- [Reproducible pulls via `--revision <SHA>`](FEATURES.md#reproducible-pulls-via---revision-sha).

### [Drop-in OpenAI + Ollama proxy](FEATURES.md#drop-in-openai--ollama-proxy)

- [OpenAI-compatible endpoint](FEATURES.md#openai-compatible-endpoint) at `http://127.0.0.1:11435/v1` by default (or the next free port up to `11440`) — drives every discovered model through one URL; OpenCode, Pi (pi.dev), Cline, llm-cli, the OpenAI SDKs all work as-is. Auto-starts the requested model; falls back to a Ready peer with audit headers (`x-llamastash-served-by`, `x-llamastash-fallback-reason`) when launch fails. The default port is `11435` (one above Ollama's well-known `11434`) so a llamastash daemon and an Ollama install can co-exist without a port collision.
- [Anthropic Messages API](FEATURES.md#anthropic-messages-api-claude-code) on the same proxy — `/v1/messages` + `/v1/messages/count_tokens` forward to llama-server's native endpoints, so Claude Code and the Anthropic SDK attach via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (key sent as `x-api-key`). `llamastash init`'s **Claude Code** integration drops a sourceable `claude-code.sh` so you opt in per-shell (`source claude-code.sh && claude`) without hijacking its global config. Tool calling works out of the box (`--jinja` on by default).
- [Browser web UI](FEATURES.md#browser-web-ui) at `http://127.0.0.1:11435/ui/` — opens the running model's stock llama.cpp web UI through the proxy on one port-stable origin, so you never chase the ephemeral backend port. A chooser (plus `/ui/switch`) handles several running models; reachable over LAN behind the same key via a browser Basic-auth prompt.
- [Ollama discovery surface](FEATURES.md#ollama-discovery-surface) — `GET /api/tags` / `/api/version` / `/api/ps`, `POST /api/show` so tools that auto-detect Ollama via `OLLAMA_HOST` recognise llamastash and fall through to the OpenAI-compat endpoints for inference.
- **Ollama drop-in mode is opt-in.** Enable with `--ollama-compat` (or `proxy.ollama_compat: true` / `LLAMASTASH_OLLAMA_COMPAT=1`) and the proxy claims port `11434`, answers `GET /` with the byte-exact `"Ollama is running"` handshake string, and works as a transparent replacement for the official `ollama` CLI and other Ollama-Go-based clients. Leaving compat off keeps the safe coexistence default (port `11435`, `"LlamaStash is running"` identity).
- [Loopback by default, opt-in LAN with auth](FEATURES.md#auth-posture) — the proxy binds `127.0.0.1` and runs keyless for the same-machine threat model. Expose it on the LAN with `--proxy-host 0.0.0.0` (or `proxy.host`) and llamastash auto-generates a bearer key, requires it on every request, and refuses to bind a routable address with no key unless you pass `--insecure-no-auth`. TLS is on the roadmap; LAN mode is plaintext for now (trusted network or front with a reverse proxy). The control plane and `llama-server` children always stay loopback.

### [NPU & multi-engine via Lemonade (experimental)](docs/lemonade-setup.md)

- **⚠️ Experimental** — new and lightly road-tested; behaviour and config may change. llama.cpp stays the stable default.
- **A pluggable backend seam.** llama.cpp is the direct, zero-overhead default; [Lemonade](https://github.com/lemonade-sdk/lemonade) (`lemond`) plugs in as a second backend for engines llama.cpp can't reach — **NPU inference** on AMD Ryzen AI / XDNA, plus ROCm / ONNX / others. Default-on when the `lemond` binary resolves (like ds4); force via `--lemonade` / `LLAMASTASH_LEMONADE=1`, or set `lemonade.enabled: false` to opt out. Zero footprint when the binary is absent.
- **You install Lemonade; LlamaStash drives it.** No auto-install — LlamaStash finds `lemond` (PATH or `lemonade.binary`), supervises the shared umbrella, discovers its models, routes inference through the proxy, and evicts idle models by API unload. See **[Lemonade setup](docs/lemonade-setup.md)**.

### [ds4 (DwarfStar) — DeepSeek V4 GGUFs](docs/usage.md#ds4-backend)

- **⚠️ Experimental** — new and lightly road-tested (validated on a single Strix Halo / ROCm box); behaviour, config, and defaults may change. llama.cpp stays the stable default and runs DeepSeek-V4 too on a current build (llama.cpp **b9840+**), so nothing depends on ds4.
- **A third backend for antirez's [ds4](https://github.com/antirez/ds4).** ds4-server is the purpose-built engine for the DeepSeek-V4 Flash/PRO GGUFs (disk KV cache, SSD streaming). A ds4-compatible GGUF auto-routes to ds4 when the `ds4-server` binary is found, and **falls back to llama.cpp when it isn't** — a current llama.cpp (**b9840+**, the first release with DeepSeek-V4 support) runs these GGUFs too, so ds4 is preferred, never required. Older llama.cpp builds can't load them (`unknown model architecture: 'deepseek4'`). Default-on when the binary resolves; enable/force via `[ds4]` config, `--ds4`, or `LLAMASTASH_DS4=1`. An SSD-streaming launch knob runs the 81–300+ GB models on below-floor RAM. See **[ds4 backend](docs/usage.md#ds4-backend)**.

### [Built to be safe to run](FEATURES.md#built-to-be-safe-to-run)

- [Bearer-token loopback control plane (`runtime.json` `0600`)](FEATURES.md#bearer-token-control-plane) — the per-daemon token + URL live in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/llamastash/runtime.json`; same-UID trust, no network exposure.
- [Hardened fetch substrate](FEATURES.md#hardened-fetch-substrate) — HTTPS-only, host allowlist, redirect/body-size caps, IP-literal refusal.
- [Archive-bomb defenses on installers](FEATURES.md#archive-bomb-defenses-on-installers) — entry/size/ratio caps; SHA-256 verified before extract.
- [Atomic, mode-checked config + state writes](FEATURES.md#atomic-mode-checked-config--state-writes) — `0600` final mode; corrupt state quarantined, not fatal.
- [Side-by-side daemons](FEATURES.md#side-by-side-daemons) — isolated instances via `LLAMASTASH_*_DIR` (state / config / cache); each daemon publishes its own `runtime.json`.

_**Note**: This is beta software. Rough edges are to be expected. Windows and macOS support is not as well-tested as Linux; Same goes for non-AMD GPUs. Please report issues if you hit them. The `llama-server` builds are unmodified upstream binaries; any bugs in them are out of scope for LlamaStash._

## Benchmarks

LlamaStash spawns the unmodified upstream `llama-server`. Three suites track what that means in practice — **Suite A** asserts the wrapper adds no measurable overhead vs raw `llama-server`, **Suite B** compares LlamaStash-as-shipped against Ollama + LM Studio on the same hardware through their OpenAI-compatible endpoints, **Suite C** measures the proxy hop vs hitting `llama-server` directly (TTFT p50 +0.45 ms, decode unchanged). Full write-up + per-workload tables: [`docs/benchmarks.md`](docs/benchmarks.md).

Each cell below is **decode tok/s / TTFT ms** on the `chat_turn` workload (50-token prompt → 64 tokens decode). LlamaStash matches raw `llama-server` within ≤1% in normalized mode on every platform. Re-run on your hardware: `make bench-end-to-end` (Suite B) or `make bench-overhead` (Suite A).

### AMD APU - Linux (Ryzen AI Max+ 395 / Radeon 8060S 128GB unified, system ROCm 7.2.3, llama.cpp build `b9440 (e6123e208)`)

`chat_turn` `normalized` mode, decode tok/s / TTFT ms. One bench JSON per row (no averaging).

¹ LM Studio's bundled ROCm vendor libraries (v6.4) abort in `ggml_cuda_error` during backend init on `gfx1151` (Strix Halo) across all LMS-shipped runtimes. System ROCm 7.2.3 loads the same models cleanly via raw `llama-server`, so this is an LMS vendor-bundle limitation. LMS Vulkan numbers are in the [benchmark blog](https://deepu.tech/benchmarking-llamastash) and in the [final report](https://github.com/llamastash/llamastash/blob/main/docs/benchmarks/linux-amd-apu-final-report.md).

#### AMD APU — Vulkan addendum (LlamaStash vs LM Studio, 2026-06-01)

| Tool             | small (E2B Q4) |   mid (31B Q4) | large_dense (27B Q8) | large_moe (35B-A3B Q8) |
| ---------------- | -------------: | -------------: | -------------------: | ---------------------: |
| **LlamaStash**   | **101.2 / 55** | **10.8 / 671** |            7.5 / 196 |          **50.7 / 72** |
| LM Studio 2.18.0 |     93.6 / 191 |     7.1 / 2307 |        **8.0 / 801** |             38.4 / 227 |

Same backend (Vulkan b9440 / `vulkan-avx2@2.18.0`), same GGUF bytes. raw `llama-server` and Ollama omitted: the wrapper-overhead claim already covered by the HIP table; Ollama mainline has no Vulkan support.

### NVIDIA - Linux (RTX 3050 Ti, 4 GiB VRAM, llama.cpp build `b9360`)

| Tool               | CUDA (gemma-3-4b Q3 `defaults`) | Vulkan (gemma-3-4b Q3 `defaults`) |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------: | --------------------------------: |
| **LlamaStash**     |                 **41.1 / 74** ✦ |                    **42.0 / 113** |
| raw `llama-server` |                      36.6 / 110 |                        37.5 / 148 |
| LM Studio 2.16.0   |                  **48.7 / 318** |                    **48.3 / 308** |
| Ollama 0.24.0      |                      40.7 / 120 |                        42.0 / 115 |

✦ LlamaStash leads raw `llama-server` in defaults mode (12–16% decode, 33–49% TTFT) via the hardware-aware defaults overlay; normalized mode: within ≤0.5 tok/s. Vulkan decode ≥ CUDA on this hardware in 26 of 28 cells (median +5%). Curated report with six findings: [`linux-nvidia-final.md`](https://github.com/llamastash/llamastash/blob/main/docs/benchmarks/linux-nvidia-final.md).

### Apple M1 - macOS (16 GB unified memory, Metal, llama.cpp build `9330 (328874d05)`)

| Tool               | small (Qwen2.5-0.5B Q4) |
| ------------------ | ----------------------: |
| **LlamaStash**     |         **95.6 / 18** ✦ |
| raw `llama-server` |               91.9 / 20 |
| LM Studio          |               88.4 / 68 |
| Ollama 0.24.0      |              79.6 / 102 |

✦ LlamaStash leads raw `llama-server` on M1 in `defaults` mode (99.0 vs 92.3 tok/s, 15 vs 19 ms TTFT) because its Metal defaults overlay injects hardware-optimal knobs at startup. Normalized mode: 92.2 vs 91.5 — within 1%. Curated report: [`macos-m1-final-report.md`](https://github.com/llamastash/llamastash/blob/main/docs/benchmarks/macos-m1-final-report.md).

LlamaStash reads `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/llamastash/config.yaml` on Linux (fallback `~/.config/llamastash/config.yaml`), `~/Library/Application Support/llamastash/config.yaml` on macOS, and `%APPDATA%\llamastash\config\config.yaml` on Windows. A fully-annotated sample lives at [`config.example.yaml`](config.example.yaml) — copy it to the path above and edit. The full schema reference is in [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md#configuration).

Quick tour of the top-level keys:

| Key                           | What it controls                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `theme`                       | Built-in palette: `macchiato` (default), `latte`, `gruvbox-dark`, `solarized-dark`, `mono`. Set to `custom` to use the `custom_theme` block. Cycle live with `t:theme`.   |
| `custom_theme`                | User-defined palette. Inherits unspecified slots from `base:` (default macchiato). Accepts `#RRGGBB` hex or ANSI names. Once defined, `Custom` joins the `t:theme` cycle. |
| `model_paths`                 | Extra directories to scan for `.gguf` files. Merged with `-p/--model-path` and `LLAMASTASH_MODEL_PATHS`.                                                                  |
| `disable_default_cache_paths` | Per-bucket toggles (`huggingface`, `ollama`, `lm_studio`) for the auto-walked caches.                                                                                     |
| `disable_scan`                | Skip filesystem scanning entirely. Same as `--no-scan` / `LLAMASTASH_NO_SCAN=1`.                                                                                          |
| `port_range`                  | Inclusive `{start, end}` TCP range the supervisor picks from. Default `41100..=41300`.                                                                                    |
| `llama_server_path`           | Absolute path to `llama-server`. Overridable by `--llama-server` and `LLAMASTASH_LLAMA_SERVER`.                                                                           |
| `probe_timeout_secs`          | Health-probe deadline per launch. Default `120`. Bump for 70B+ on slow disks.                                                                                             |
| `keybindings`                 | Action-name → key-spec overrides. Kdash-style dialect (`ctrl+q`, `shift+tab`, `f1`, …).                                                                                   |

| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LLAMASTASH_CONFIG`       | Override config-file path                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `LLAMASTASH_LLAMA_SERVER` | Path to `llama-server`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `LLAMASTASH_NO_SCAN`      | Skip filesystem scanning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `LLAMASTASH_IPC_URL`      | Point a CLI/TUI at a non-default daemon control plane (verbatim URL, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:48134`). Must be set together with `LLAMASTASH_IPC_TOKEN`.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `LLAMASTASH_IPC_TOKEN`    | Bearer token for the control-plane URL. See `LLAMASTASH_IPC_URL`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `LLAMASTASH_OFFLINE`      | Disable outbound network for `init`, `pull`, and `doctor` fetch paths. Accepts `true` / `false` when bound via clap's `--offline` flag; the runtime `fetch::offline_requested` check also accepts `1` / `yes` for compatibility with scripts that follow the `XDG`/`gh` convention. Equivalent to `--offline`. |
| `HF_TOKEN`                | HuggingFace API token. Read by `init` and `pull` only; never propagated into spawned `llama-server` children. Cache-file (`~/.cache/huggingface/token`) source is refused if its mode is group/world-readable.                                                                                                 |
| `HF_ENDPOINT`             | Override the HuggingFace API endpoint host. Must be `https://` and on the HF-allowlist (`huggingface.co` and its LFS CDN); non-allowlisted values are refused. Default: `https://huggingface.co`.                                                                                                              |

### Default scan paths

When `model_paths` and `--model-path` are empty, LlamaStash walks these caches automatically. Each bucket is independently toggleable via `disable_default_cache_paths.<bucket>: true` in `config.yaml`, or globally via `--no-scan` / `LLAMASTASH_NO_SCAN=1`.

| Bucket      | Linux                                             | macOS                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| HuggingFace | `~/.cache/huggingface/hub`                        | `~/Library/Caches/huggingface/hub`                       |
| Ollama      | `~/.ollama/models`                                | `~/.ollama/models`                                       |
| LM Studio   | `~/.lmstudio/models`, `~/.cache/lm-studio/models` | `~/Library/Caches/LMStudio/models`, `~/.lmstudio/models` |

Files anywhere under these roots that end in `.gguf` (and aren't `.gguf.part`) get parsed and added to the catalog.

## CLI exit codes

Every non-interactive subcommand returns a documented exit code so agent scripts can branch on failure class. Pin against numbers, not message text — they are the public contract.

| Code | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `64` | Usage error (missing required arg, invalid combination — clap-emitted)                                                                                                                                         |

| `67` | `start_model` failed at the supervisor (probe timeout, port allocation failure)                                                                                                                                |
| `68` | `stop_model` / `stop_all` failed                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `69` | `pull` download failed (transport, checksum, or HF cache write)                                                                                                                                                |
| `70` | `llama-server` binary not found (`--llama-server`, `LLAMASTASH_LLAMA_SERVER`, or `$PATH`)                                                                                                                      |
| `71` | Unexpected error (catch-all)                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `72` | `init` aborted before substantive work — failed precondition, integrity check, or rate-limited GH API. Safe to re-run.                                                                                         |
| `73` | `init` download failed mid-step — disk space, transport, or HF cache write. Partial state recorded; re-run picks up where it stopped.                                                                          |
| `74` | `init` smoke-launch failed — phase-1 dry-run exceeded VRAM ceiling, or `--version` probe returned non-zero. Binary is installed; re-run smoke with `init --only smoke` or use `llamastash doctor` to diagnose. |

> **Note on sysexits.h**: the numbers above are deliberately reused from `<sysexits.h>` for familiarity, but LlamaStash's _meanings_ diverge from the standard ones. Scripts that import `EX_NOHOST` (68) expecting "host unreachable" will get our "stop failed"; `EX_DATAERR` (65) is reused for "daemon unreachable", not "data error". Branch on LlamaStash's table above, not the libc constants.

## Platforms

Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (Apple Silicon, Intel), and Windows 11 (x86_64). One binary, one TUI, one CLI — the daemon's control plane is bearer-token-authed HTTP loopback on every platform, and the supervisor uses the OS's native process-group semantics (POSIX `setsid` + signals, Windows Job Objects + CTRL+BREAK). Windows AMD GPU detection and `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc` are on the roadmap.

### Supported llama-server version

LlamaStash hands GPU/CPU placement and context sizing to llama.cpp's `--fit` (on by default), so it needs a `llama-server` that has it.

- **Minimum: build `b7410`** (2025-12-15), the first release carrying `--fit` / `--fit-ctx` (llama.cpp [PR #16653](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/16653)). Older builds abort on the unknown argument the moment a model launches.
- **Recommended: a recent build** (`b8500`+, 2026). The May 2026 AMD GPU-stack updates (kernel, amdgpu firmware, ROCm) materially improved `--fit` on unified memory; verified on `b9245`.

llama.cpp has no semantic versioning, no stable branch, and no stability policy ([discussion #16111](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/16111)) — it tags ~10-14 rolling builds a day. So the build number is a floor for _flag existence_, not a behaviour guarantee; LlamaStash's own pre-spawn admission control is what actually prevents out-of-memory launches regardless of build. `llamastash init` installs a known-good build for your hardware.

## Roadmap

Tracked in detail in [`TODO.md`](https://github.com/llamastash/llamastash/blob/main/TODO.md). The headline items on deck:

- **llama.cpp version pinning** — prevent silent drift / incompatibility on `brew upgrade`.
- **MCP and LAN-exposed HTTP surfaces** — Model Context Protocol, plus auth + TLS + LAN binding for the proxy. The loopback OpenAI-compatible proxy ships today (see [Drop-in OpenAI + Ollama proxy](#drop-in-openai--ollama-proxy)); the rest of the v1 R34 deferral (Anthropic compat, MCP, network exposure) stays on the roadmap.
- **Anthropic API compatibility** — `/v1/messages` shim on top of the existing OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
- **Per-PID VRAM attribution** via NVML's `nvmlDeviceGetComputeRunningProcesses`. Today the right pane shows per-model RAM + CPU%; VRAM is reported only at the host level.
- **GPU/CPU offload split UI** — first-class control over which layers go where.
- **Windows AMD GPU detection** — pick a probe path (DXGI / WMI / ADLX). 0.0.2 shows "GPU detection unavailable" on Windows AMD hosts.
- **`aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`** — Snapdragon X / Surface Pro coverage. Deferred from 0.0.2.
- **MLX and vLLM backends** — if the surface area lands cheaply alongside llama.cpp.
- **Docker-ready packaging** — official images plus a documented `docker run` path.
