# LlamaDash 🦙

A fast, keyboard-driven TUI **and** CLI for launching local `llama-server` (llama.cpp) instances.

> **Status: v1 work in progress.** Scope: [`docs/brainstorms/llamatui-requirements.md`](docs/brainstorms/llamatui-requirements.md). Implementation plan: [`docs/plans/2026-05-13-001-feat-llamatui-v1-launcher-plan.md`](docs/plans/2026-05-13-001-feat-llamatui-v1-launcher-plan.md).

## Why

Heavy abstractions (Ollama, LM Studio) hide llama.cpp; raw `llama-server` use is tedious. LlamaDash is a fast, transparent launcher that is also a first-class shell-tool surface for agents — one binary, daemon on demand, same primitives in the TUI and the CLI.

## What it does (v1)

- **Discovers GGUF models on disk** — your own paths plus HuggingFace, Ollama, and LM Studio caches — grouped by directory with live filesystem watching.
- **Surfaces rich GGUF metadata** — architecture, quantization, native context length, KV-cache-aware memory estimates.
- **Launches `llama-server`** through a keyboard-driven picker (context length, reasoning toggle, advanced flags); supports named per-model **presets** and **favorites**.
- **Supervises multiple concurrent models** with a health-probed state machine. Running models survive TUI exit.
- **Smoke-tests models** via a right-pane Chat / Embed / Rerank tab that hits the same OpenAI-compatible endpoints any external client would use.
- **Exposes a complete non-interactive CLI** — `list`, `start`, `stop`, `status`, `logs`, `presets`, `favorites`, `daemon`. Every read command supports `--json`. Distinct exit codes per failure class.

## v2 and beyond will add:
- Init command to install llama.cpp (brew or custom), set up config, etc.
- Skills
- HuggingFace pull (origin: R46).
- Custom themes
- HTTP and MCP surfaces (origin: R34).
- Anthropic API compatibility
- Maybe MLX and vLLM if its easy to add
- Docker Ready
- **Per-PID VRAM attribution via NVML.** Today the right-pane block title surfaces per-model RAM + CPU%; per-model VRAM is reported only at the host level. v2 unlocks per-launch VRAM via NVML's `nvmlDeviceGetComputeRunningProcesses` (Linux + Windows; AMD/Apple parity depends on upstream surface).

## Install

> Pre-1.0 binaries are not yet published. Build from source for now.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/llamadash/llamadash
cd llamadash
cargo install --path .
```

`cargo install llamadash`, a Homebrew tap, and pre-built release binaries land alongside the first tagged release.

You also need `llama-server` on your `PATH` (or pointed at via `--llama-server <path>` / `LLAMADASH_LLAMA_SERVER`).

> **macOS pre-1.0 release tarballs are not yet codesigned.** Until the signing step lands in the release workflow, Gatekeeper will quarantine the unzipped binary. Run `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./llamadash` once after download to clear the flag.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Open the TUI. Scans default caches; daemon auto-spawns on demand.
llamadash

# List discovered models (TSV by default, JSON for agents).
llamadash list
llamadash list --json | jq

# Launch a model by name, name substring, path, or canonical id.
llamadash start qwen-coder --ctx 16384 --reasoning on

# Drive a smoke-test request against the running endpoint.
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:41100/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model": "qwen-coder", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]}'

# Stop it.
llamadash stop qwen-coder
```

Full subcommand reference: [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md). Architecture and IPC contract: [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md). When things go wrong: [`docs/troubleshooting.md`](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## CLI exit codes

Every non-interactive subcommand returns a documented exit code so agent scripts can branch on failure class. Pin against numbers, not message text — they are the public contract.

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0`  | Success |
| `64` | Usage error (missing required arg, invalid combination — clap-emitted) |
| `65` | Daemon unreachable (socket missing, peer hung up, timeout) |
| `66` | Model reference matched zero or multiple models (stderr lists candidates) |
| `67` | `start_model` failed at the supervisor (probe timeout, port allocation failure) |
| `68` | `stop_model` / `stop_all` failed |
| `69` | Reserved for `pull` (lands with R46 in v2) |
| `70` | `llama-server` binary not found (`--llama-server`, `LLAMADASH_LLAMA_SERVER`, or `$PATH`) |
| `71` | Unexpected error (catch-all) |

> **Note on sysexits.h**: the numbers above are deliberately reused from `<sysexits.h>` for familiarity, but LlamaDash's *meanings* diverge from the standard ones. Scripts that import `EX_NOHOST` (68) expecting "host unreachable" will get our "stop failed"; `EX_DATAERR` (65) is reused for "daemon unreachable", not "data error". Branch on LlamaDash's table above, not the libc constants.

## Configuration

LlamaDash reads `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/llamadash/config.yaml` (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/llamadash/config.yaml`). Schema in [`docs/usage.md`](docs/usage.md). Environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LLAMADASH_CONFIG` | Override config-file path |
| `LLAMADASH_LLAMA_SERVER` | Path to `llama-server` |
| `LLAMADASH_NO_SCAN` | Skip filesystem scanning |
| `LLAMADASH_SOCKET` | Point a CLI at a non-default daemon socket |

### Default scan paths

When `model_paths` and `--model-path` are empty, LlamaDash walks these caches automatically. Each bucket is independently toggleable via `disable_default_cache_paths.<bucket>: true` in `config.yaml`, or globally via `--no-scan` / `LLAMADASH_NO_SCAN=1`.

| Bucket | Linux | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| HuggingFace | `~/.cache/huggingface/hub` | `~/Library/Caches/huggingface/hub` |
| Ollama | `~/.ollama/models` | `~/.ollama/models` |
| LM Studio | `~/.lmstudio/models`, `~/.cache/lm-studio/models` | `~/Library/Caches/LMStudio/models`, `~/.lmstudio/models` |

Files anywhere under these roots that end in `.gguf` (and aren't `.gguf.part`) get parsed and added to the catalog.

## Platforms

Linux (x86_64, aarch64) and macOS (Apple Silicon, Intel). Windows is out of scope for v1.
