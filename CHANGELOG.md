# Changelog

All notable changes to llamastash will be documented in this file. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project intends to follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) starting with the first stable release.

## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet — open a PR to put something here._

## [0.0.1] — 2026-05-20

The first publicly-installable llamastash release. Bundles every commit since the project's inception under a single WIP release; the version reflects pre-1.0 status. Distribution lands across three channels (Cargo, Homebrew tap, GitHub-hosted install script) with end-to-end automated release-on-tag; a marketing site at [llamastash.cli.rs](https://llamastash.cli.rs) ships alongside.

### Added (interactive wizard + colored CLI)

- **Interactive `init` install picker offers a "Custom path…" option.** Selecting it prompts for an absolute path to an existing `llama-server` binary and routes it through the same `install_from_custom_path` adoption pipeline as `--install custom:PATH`. Closes the gap where users with self-built binaries had no way to point at them from the interactive wizard (the CLI flag worked but the menu didn't list it).
- **Interactive `init` wizard.** `llamastash init` now opens a `cliclack`-powered stepped wizard by default: install-method pick, model pick, config-write confirm. Pass `--recommended` to accept every hardware-aware default without prompting (the legacy `--yes` is preserved as a hidden permanent alias). Three per-step flags pre-answer individual prompts without skipping the rest: `--install <brew|gh-releases|existing|custom:PATH>`, `--model <recommended|none|owner/repo>`, `--config-step <write|skip>`. Non-TTY stdout auto-falls-back to recommended defaults with a single stderr warning. The unused `dialoguer` dep is removed; `cliclack` replaces it.
- **Colored CLI output.** Every human-readable surface now ships colored output by default — success-green, error-red, warning-yellow, dim-secondary. The new global `--no-colors` flag plus `NO_COLOR` env-var detection (per https://no-color.org) and non-TTY stdout detection are OR-ed together; any one silences ANSI. `--json` output is byte-stable regardless. Policy lives in `src/cli/colors.rs`, initialised once in `cli::dispatch`.

### Changed (wizard ergonomics + error reporting)

- **`llamastash init` shows live progress for long steps.** Every long-running phase the wizard runs (Homebrew install, GitHub Releases query + download + extract, HuggingFace per-file download, benchmark-snapshot fetch, smoke probe) now drives a `cliclack` spinner with a present-tense narration message that flips to a `✓` success line (or `✗` failure line) on completion. Replaces the previous "blinking cursor for several minutes" UX. Non-TTY runs fall back to static themed `cliclack::log` lines; `--json` mode emits no progress at all so the structured-stdout contract stays byte-stable.
- **Config-diff confirmation gets light syntax coloring.** The dry-run preview the wizard shows before writing `config.yaml` now colors the `+` / `~` markers, bold-cyans the dotted key path, and dims the "(no changes)" line. Honors the existing `--no-colors` / `NO_COLOR` / non-TTY downgrade rules.
- **Smoke probe step now narrates what it did and reports concrete numbers.** Success line shows peak memory estimate vs effective ceiling (e.g. `phase-1 fits (peak ~5.6 GiB vs ceiling 9.0 GiB); llama-server reports build 5037 (b00d09c)`) instead of the prior terse `phase-1 + --version OK (binary version:)`. `--verbose` now emits debug lines for each smoke sub-step (phase-1 inputs/result, `--version` spawn/return, peak vs ceiling). The version parser handles modern llama.cpp output (`version: NNNN (bHASH)`) which previously fell through to the regex and returned just `version:`.
- **`--verbose` now tees debug logs to stderr in addition to the log file.** The file logger remains the source of truth (full module surface at Debug level); the new stderr tee filters to `llamastash::*` records so dependency noise from hyper/reqwest/tokio doesn't drown out wizard-internal logs. Added `log::debug!` step boundaries in the init wizard so `--verbose` produces actually-useful output for a happy-path run.
- **CLI errors walk the full `std::error::Error::source()` chain.** `CliExit::prefix` (used by every wizard / pull / config error path) now appends every layer of the source chain into the message, so a wrapped hf-hub→reqwest→io error shows as `init download: hf-hub: request error: ... : connection reset by peer` instead of just the top-level wrapper. `DownloadError::Hub` now stores the `hf_hub::ApiError` directly (was a stringified `String`) so the chain isn't severed at the conversion boundary.

### Fixed

- **`llamastash init` model step no longer fails with "returned zero matching files" on sharded GGUF repos.** Three benchmark-snapshot entries (`Qwen/Qwen2.5-{7B,14B,32B}-Instruct-GGUF`) point at a single unsharded filename, but those repos only host the `q4_k_m` weights split across 2/3/5 shards. The download filter now falls back to the canonical `<stem>-NNNNN-of-NNNNN.<ext>` shard pattern when the exact pinned filename has no match, and pulls every shard. llama.cpp loads the shard set natively from the first shard, so the smoke probe and config write keep working unchanged.

### Added (init wizard, doctor, pull)

- **Interactive `init` wizard.** `llamastash init` now opens a `cliclack`-powered stepped wizard by default: install-method pick, model pick, config-write confirm. Pass `--recommended` to accept every hardware-aware default without prompting (the legacy `--yes` is preserved as a hidden permanent alias). Three per-step flags pre-answer individual prompts without skipping the rest: `--install <brew|gh-releases|existing|custom:PATH>`, `--model <recommended|none|owner/repo>`, `--config-step <write|skip>`. Non-TTY stdout auto-falls-back to recommended defaults with a single stderr warning. The unused `dialoguer` dep is removed; `cliclack` replaces it.
- **Colored CLI output.** Every human-readable surface now ships colored output by default — success-green, error-red, warning-yellow, dim-secondary. The new global `--no-colors` flag plus `NO_COLOR` env-var detection (per https://no-color.org) and non-TTY stdout detection are OR-ed together; any one silences ANSI. `--json` output is byte-stable regardless. Policy lives in `src/cli/colors.rs`, initialised once in `cli::dispatch`.

- **`llamastash init`** — first-run setup wizard (R48). Six-step flow: detect hardware + binary → install `llama-server` per OS×GPU class → recommend + download a starter GGUF → write `config.yaml` with `arch_defaults` → smoke launch → handoff to the TUI. `--yes` accepts hardware-aware defaults; `--json` emits a structured summary; `--offline` disables outbound network. `--only`/`--skip` scope per-step re-runs (e.g. `init --only server` to re-install after a GPU swap).
- **`llamastash doctor`** — read-only diagnostic (R74). Re-runs detection, diffs against `_init_snapshot.json`, emits 0-6 findings with stable ids agents can branch on: `binary_missing`, `binary_digest_drift` (GH Releases only — brew installs carved out), `hardware_drift`, `snapshot_stale`, `config_mode_drift`, `remote_snapshot_unreachable`. `--json` emits a stable envelope; output is always safe to paste into a public issue.
- **`llamastash pull <hf-repo>`** — HuggingFace pull primitive (R65), graduated from the v1 `unimplemented!` stub. Built on the [`hf-hub`](https://crates.io/crates/hf-hub) crate (0.5 line, which resolves the same `reqwest 0.12` we pin elsewhere — no transitive collision). Accepts `owner/repo` or `owner/repo:filename.gguf`; honors `HF_TOKEN`; refuses cache-file tokens with insecure modes; performs a disk-space precheck (R64) by HEAD-ing each filtered file via hf-hub's `Api::metadata`.
- **`arch_defaults` config block** — per-architecture launch defaults (`qwen2`, `llama`, …) merged into `LaunchParams.advanced` at start-model time, only for flags the caller has not already supplied. R69 precedence: preset > last-params > arch defaults > built-in.
- **`init_snapshot.json`** — sibling of `state.json` under the state dir. Records hardware vendor / VRAM / binary path + SHA-256 / install method / managed_keys with blake3 value digests. Atomic write + 0600 + parse-fail quarantine.
- **Bundled benchmark snapshot** — `data/benchmark-snapshot.json` ships in the binary via `include_str!` (500 KiB build-time cap). Daily CI workflow (`.github/workflows/regenerate-benchmark-snapshot.yml`) refreshes the rolling `snapshot-latest` Release asset; rollback-DoS gate via monotonic `bundle_date` + `min_version` ≤ build.
- **Path-A recommender** — VRAM-fit hard filter + composite ranker (benchmark × tok/s × params × recency) with per-pick justification (R58). Release-blocking 16/20 corpus check; weights tunable from the snapshot.
- **Network fetch substrate (`src/init/fetch.rs`)** — HTTPS-only `FetchClient` with host allowlist, redirect cap, body-size cap, IP-literal refusal-via-allowlist. Used by snapshot fetch, GH Releases install, and `llamastash pull`. `--offline` / `LLAMASTASH_OFFLINE` short-circuits before any DNS.
- **GH Releases install path (`src/init/install/`)** — fetches `ggml-org/llama.cpp` releases, picks the asset by `(os, arch, gpu)` suffix (Vulkan default for Linux+Nvidia per the Unit 1 spike's breaking finding — no CUDA prebuilt exists upstream), verifies SHA-256 from the asset's `digest` field, safe-extracts with archive-bomb defenses (entry count cap, total size cap, compression-ratio cap, hardlink + symlink + absolute-path + `..` refusal).
- **Exit codes 72/73/74** — `INIT_ABORTED` (integrity check failed, daemon stop/restart could not be coerced), `INIT_DOWNLOAD_FAILED` (wizard's download step), `INIT_SMOKE_FAILED` (probe phase). Distinct from `PULL_FAILED=69` so agents branch on cause.
- **Smoke phase 1 + `--version` probe (`src/init/smoke.rs`)** — pre-launch VRAM ceiling check + binary executes-cleanly probe with `env_clear()` minimal env. Phase 2 (daemon-mediated `/health` + `/v1/chat/completions`) is deferred to v2.1.

### Internal

- **Vendored benchmark scrapers** — `scripts/benchmark_sources/{whichllm,open_llm_leaderboard,aider}.py` now run live against the Open LLM Leaderboard rows API and Aider's polyglot YAML in the daily snapshot regen cron, replacing the `TODO(unit7-v2-ga)` placeholders. Partial vendoring of [`Andyyyy64/whichllm`](https://github.com/Andyyyy64/whichllm) (MIT) pinned at commit `73cd92f`; deps pinned in `scripts/requirements.txt`. CI-only — R45 single-binary invariant preserved, no Rust artefact change.

### Added (launcher + smoke-test + CLI)

- Daemon-on-demand architecture: single `llamastash` binary that acts as TUI, CLI, **and** daemon depending on the subcommand. Daemon owns `llama-server` children and persisted state; clients attach over a `0600` Unix socket authenticated via peer credentials.
- GGUF header parser with model identity = `(canonical path, BLAKE3 of header)`; KV-cache-aware memory estimator.
- Asynchronous filesystem scanner that surfaces HuggingFace, Ollama, and LM Studio caches plus user-configured roots; depth-limited HF watcher; per-file `(path, mtime, size)` metadata cache.
- Process supervisor: `Launching → Loading → Ready / Error → Stopping → Stopped` state machine; port allocator; `/health` probe; per-model log file plus 4K-line ring buffer; SIGTERM→SIGKILL stop semantics; orphan re-adoption with three-factor (PID alive + port listening + `/v1/models` path match) confirmation.
- Persisted state: favorites, presets, last-params, running snapshot. Temp-file + rename writes; corruption quarantine.
- Five themes — Catppuccin Macchiato (default), Catppuccin Latte, Gruvbox Dark, Solarized Dark, Monochrome.
- TUI: list pane with directory grouping + favorites + filter; launch picker pre-populated from `last_params`; advanced flag panel; clipboard yank (URL / curl / model path) with `arboard` + `wl-copy` / `xclip` / `xsel` fallbacks.
- TUI right pane: per-tab text input focus; streaming Chat tab with `<think>` collapse; Embed and Rerank one-shot tabs; live Logs tab tail with auto-scroll toggle.
- CLI: `list`, `start`, `stop`, `status`, `logs`, `presets`, `favorites`, `daemon` — `--json` everywhere relevant; documented exit codes; auto-spawn-daemon flow with `--no-spawn` opt-out.
- `status` IPC and CLI surface include a `daemon` health block (`pid`, `uptime_seconds`, `active_connections`).
- `stop_external` IPC for terminating unmanaged `llama-server` processes the daemon surfaced read-only.
- GPU detection: NVML on Linux + system_profiler on Apple Silicon, falling back to AMD `rocm-smi` shellout, then Vulkan, then CPU-only.

### Deferred to a later release
- HTTP and MCP server surfaces (R34).
- Smoke phase 2 (daemon-mediated `/health` + chat completion probe). 0.0.1 ships phase 1 + `--version`; phase 2 lands once the daemon stop+restart helpers are exported through the IPC surface.
- TUI `_init_snapshot`-aware maintenance nudge for doctor findings (open question in the plan; user-data-driven follow-up).
- Range-resume on partial HF downloads (requires a future hf-hub line that exposes a custom-`reqwest::Client` hook without a reqwest 0.13 transitive — see `docs/spikes/2026-05-19-hf-hub-client-injection.md`).

### Notes
- Commit `43cce21` (round-8 polish) describes the Shift key glyph
  as the Nerd Font codepoint `󰘶`. The shipped code never used that
  codepoint — `SHIFT_GLYPH` in `src/tui/keybindings.rs` is the
  standard Unicode `⇧` (U+21E7). The Nerd Font codepoints were
  scrubbed wholesale in the very next commit (`0ee01df`). No
  behaviour change; this note is for archaeology.

## How to read this file

Tagged releases land under their version heading; in-flight work accumulates under **Unreleased** until the next tag promotes it. llamastash is pre-1.0 / WIP; the entire pre-release history is bundled under the first publishable tag, [0.0.1], rather than backfilled into a series of synthetic tags. The ledger starts there.
